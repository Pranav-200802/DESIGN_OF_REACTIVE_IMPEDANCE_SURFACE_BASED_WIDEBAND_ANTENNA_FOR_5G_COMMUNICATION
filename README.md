# Circularly Polarized Wi-Fi Antenna with Reactive Impedance Surface (RIS)

This project proposes a circularly polarized antenna for Wi-Fi applications by incorporating the principle of Reactive Impedance Surface (RIS) to enhance bandwidth. The initial design frequency is targeted at 5.3 GHz. The antenna design exhibits excellent performance in terms of bandwidth, return loss, gain, and Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR). The use of RIS significantly improves the antenna's transmission properties and overall bandwidth.

## Antenna Design and RIS Integration

The antenna design is based on a pentagonal patch, which is a conventional antenna structure. To widen the bandwidth, the pentagonal patch is augmented with the Reactive Impedance Surface (RIS) principle. The RIS layer, located below the pentagonal patch, acts as a coupling capacitance and provides impedance matching to the substrate.

The key features of the RIS layer include:
- A 2x2 array of single cell structures operating at around 5.3 GHz.
- A completely reactive impedance plane with a specified surface reactance that can be adjusted relative to perfect magnetic and electric surfaces.

## Antenna Performance

The integration of the RIS layer results in enhanced antenna performance, with the following parameters:

- Return Loss: 46.5333 dB
- Gain: Up to 5.63 dBi
- VSWR: Approximately 0.0819
- Impedance Bandwidth: 6.61%
- Radiation Efficiency: 76%

## Benefits and Applications

The circularly polarized Wi-Fi antenna with the Reactive Impedance Surface (RIS) offers several advantages, including:

- **Enhanced Bandwidth**: The RIS integration widens the antenna's bandwidth, allowing for better data transmission and reception capabilities.

- **Miniaturization Factor**: The optimal use of RIS results in a miniaturized antenna design, making it suitable for compact and space-constrained applications.

- **Improved Performance**: The RIS layer not only enhances the bandwidth but also improves other important antenna parameters like return loss, gain, and VSWR, leading to superior overall performance.

The antenna is ideal for Wi-Fi applications, particularly in scenarios where a circularly polarized signal is required, such as wireless communication, IoT devices, and various other wireless connectivity applications.
